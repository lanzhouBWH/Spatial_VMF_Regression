Spatial_VMF_Regression
=====================

This repository contains code for the manuscript "Spatial von-Mises Fisher Regression for Directional Data", including scripts to reproduce Figure 4 in Section 4.1.

Setup
-----
- Put the folder 'Spatial_VMF_Regression' under the root directory.
- Ensure all functions in the 'Functions' folder are sourced.

Main Script
-----------
- 'Reproduce_Figure4.R' replicates Figure 4:
  * Set 'run = FALSE' (default) to load saved results from 'Codes_to_reproduce_Figure4/Simulation_Output/' (Due to the journal upload limitation, only 20 replications are given).
  * Set 'run = TRUE' to rerun simulations and overwrite outputs in that folder.
  * The figures will be saved in 'Codes_to_reproduce_Figure4/Figures/'

Simulation Scripts
------------------
- Located in the 'Code' folder:
  * VMF_SIM.R: Spatial VMF regression
  * NORMAL_SIM.R: Gaussian regression
  * NonSpatial_VMF_SIM.R: Non-spatial VMF regression
- Each script includes steps: 1. Data generation; 2. MCMC fitting; 3. Evaluation metric calculation

Simulation Outputs
------------------
- Files are saved in 'Simulation_Output/' with names indicating model, kappa, and replication number.
  * "VMF_FITTING_P_XX_kappa_YY_Rep_NN.Rdata": NN-th simulation output for spatial VMF regression with P=XX, kappa=YY
  * "VMF_Normal1__kappa_YY_Rep_NN.Rdata": NN-th simulation output for Gaussian Regression 1 with kappa=YY
  * "VMF_Normal2__kappa_YY_Rep_NN.Rdata": NN-th simulation output for Gaussian Regression 2 with kappa=YY
  * "NonSpatial_VMF_FITTING_kappa_YY_Rep_NN.Rdata": NN-th simulation output for spatial VMF regression kappa=YY

- Each .Rdata file includes evaluation metrics as two VÃ—M matrices (V = number of voxels, M = number of subjects):
  * Separation Angles: Stored in objects like Validation_*$alpha, representing the angle between predicted and true directions.
  * Rooted RMSE: Stored in objects like Validation_*regular$alpha, representing the rooted mean square error of directional predictions.
