VMF_Regression_Codes
=====================

This code repository accompanies the manuscript "Spatial von-Mises Fisher Regression for Directional Data", 
supporting Section 4.1: Method Comparison.

The main folder 'VMF_Regression_Codes' contains two subfolders:

1. Functions
------------

This folder includes all function definitions required for running the analyses.

- VMF_Reg.R  
  It contains the main function 'VMF_Reg()' that implements the MCMC algorithm for the spatial von Mises Fisher regression.  
  Details of the function arguments are provided within the body of the function.

- Packages.R  
  This script ensures all necessary R packages are installed and loaded.  
  Please run this script before executing any other code.

2. 4_1_Method_Comparison
------------------------

This folder contains all the code, simulation results, and figures to replicate the results presented 
in Section 4.1: Method Comparison of the Manuscript.

Code
~~~~
Includes two subfolders:

- Simulation_Code  
  Provides three scripts for generating simulation outputs.  
  Note: These simulations were run on a High Performance Computing (HPC) environment, 
  and the outputs of values of evaluation metrics (Seperation Angles and Rooted root mean square error) are stored in "Simulation_Output"
  For conciseness, each method  A typical example is provided for demonstration. The code comments in each script shows three major steps: a) Simulation Data Generation (Training and Validation); b) MCMC fitting; c) Evaluation Metrics
  * VMF_SIM: The simulation script for spatial vmf regression
  * NORMAL_SIM: The simulation script for spatial vmf regression
  * NonSpatial_VMF_SIM: The simulation script for non-spatial vmf regression
  
- Visualization_Code  
  "Figure4.R" visualize simulation results, i.e., Figure 4.
